// Scoring calibration
//
// Feud points are naturally bounded by group size: a feud answer is worth the
// number of group members who gave that same answer (1 .. N-1). To keep the
// trivia stream balanced against the feud stream, we derive a calibration
// constant from the group's own answer distributions rather than hard-coding.
//
// Per round a team plays `teamSize` feud turns and `teamSize` trivia questions.
//   feud potential   ≈ teamSize × (avg top-bucket size of usable questions)
//   trivia potential  = teamSize × (trivia point value)
// Setting trivia point value = avg top-bucket size makes one round's feud
// potential ≈ its trivia potential. Uniform point values also guarantee the
// two teams carry equal total trivia value per round.
